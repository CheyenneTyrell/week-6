# week 6
Working with API
This week we created a Contact book app where we introduced the concept of working with API.
Contacts Book App
Welcome to my first-ever API-integrated app – a bold attempt at building a powerful and visually striking contacts book. This journey was filled with unexpected challenges, learning curves, and a lot of code written from scratch.
Project Overview
This app is intended to be a modern, aggressively styled contacts book with API integration. The goal was to create something fast, functional, and visually unique – a contacts manager that doesn’t look or feel generic.
My Experience
This was my first time writing code that involved API integration, and it was far from smooth:
The files and structure that were supposed to be provided weren't available.
I ended up writing the entire app architecture myself – from the API routes to the frontend components.
As expected, my code hit several bumps along the way.
I leaned heavily on ChatGPT to help me debug, re-structure, and understand concepts in real-time.
Despite all that, I managed to build a fully working app that integrates an API to manage contacts.
What I Learned
API basics: setting up routes, handling requests, and parsing responses.
Frontend-backend communication.
Debugging errors on my own with guidance from AI assistance.
The importance of structure, naming conventions, and planning before diving into code.
Current Status
While the app works, I’m not yet satisfied with its:
Performance: Some areas feel slow or clunky.
Layout/UI: It's far from the aggressive, bold style I envisioned.
This is still a work in progress, and I plan to keep experimenting with UI frameworks, animations, and optimization techniques to bring it closer to my vision.
What's Next
Revamp the UI for a more aggressive and visually unique aesthetic.
Improve API response times and optimize frontend performance.
Refactor code to make it cleaner and more modular.
Thanks to ChatGPT for helping me debug, understand APIs, and stay sane through the toughest parts of this project.
